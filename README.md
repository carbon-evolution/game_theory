# Game Theory Strategy Simulation

This project simulates and visualizes different strategies in game theory, comparing their performance over multiple rounds of interaction.

## Features

- Simulation of four classic strategies:
  - Always Cooperate
  - Always Defect
  - Tit for Tat
  - Random
- Performance analysis including:
  - Final scores
  - Average growth per round
  - Volatility
  - Behavior patterns
- Visualization of strategy performance over time
- Tabular results display

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Tabulate

## Usage

Run the simulation:

```
python game_theory.py
```

## Data

The repository includes `strategies_data.csv` which contains historical strategy choices with timestamps.
